# CONSECUTIVE DAYS AT THE STUDIO

## A Python experiment to create a timecard for logging my time spent at the studio

I created a simple Python script that allows me to timestamp my presence in the workspace.
The data is stored in t.txt and will be used as basic material for generative art.

I added the possibility to log thoughts as strings in m.txt by using --text

I will fill this github repo with additional content as the project evolves.

### Instructions

- Clone this repository

        git clone https://github.com/tripledoublev/timesheet.git

- Move into the proper directory 

        cd timesheet

- Log in or out with --time

        python3 app.py --time IN
    or

        python3 app.py --time OUT

- Log your thoughts with --text

        python3 app.py -text "Your text comes here"

- Enjoy timekeeping
