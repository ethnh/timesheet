# CONSECUTIVE DAYS AT THE STUDIO
## VINCENT CHARLEBOIS, 2022

## A Python experiment to create a timecard for logging my time spent at the studio

I create a simple Python script that allows me to timestamp my presence in my art studio
The data is stored in t.txt and will be used as basic material for generative art

I will fill this repo with additional content as the project evolves
