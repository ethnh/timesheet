# CONSECUTIVE DAYS AT THE STUDIO

## A Python experiment to create a timecard for logging my time spent at the studio

I created a simple Python script that allows me to timestamp my presence in my workspace.
The data is stored in t.txt and will be used as basic material for generative art.

I will fill this github repo with additional content as the project evolves.

        git clone https://github.com/tripledoublev/timesheet.git
